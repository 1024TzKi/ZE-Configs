# csgo-cfgs

A collection of entWatch/stripper configs that I've done for CS:GO ZE, please be aware this is not an extensive list of everything used on GFL.

Most changes are done by me, but some bits and pieces may come from the [Mapeadores strippers](https://github.com/Mapeadores/stripper-cfgs) or other people.
